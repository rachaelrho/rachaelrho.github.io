Hi All -- I wanted to share an interesting, H2O Flow hands-on workshop I participated in with the [H2O Open Tour conference] (http://open.h2o.ai/) last week. H2O Flow is a notebook-stype open-source user interface for H2O, similar to an iPython Notebook or an Rstudio. Many thanks to Amy for walking us through this intro!
